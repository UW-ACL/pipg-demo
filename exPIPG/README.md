# exPIPG: Extrapolated Proportional Integral Projected Gradient Method

Run [`main.m`](main.m) to solve the optimal control problem for a specified problem size using different solvers. There are also options for generating C code fo exPIPG using MATLAB Coder.

See [this document](docs/docs.pdf) for details on the optimal control problem considered and infeasibility detection using exPIPG.
